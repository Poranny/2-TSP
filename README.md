# 2-TSP solver

A comprehensive Python implementation of heuristic algorithms for the 2-cycle Traveling Salesman Problem (2-TSP), encompassing constructive methods (greedy and regret-based cycle algorithms), local search heuristics (vertex and edge-based steepest descent, candidate moves, move-list strategies), and advanced metaheuristics (Multi-Start Local Search, Iterated Local Search, Large Neighborhood Search), as well as evolutionary algorithms.

Core features are verified using rudimentary pytest tests.
Simple solution visualization using matplotlib is also included.
